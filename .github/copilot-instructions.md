# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions (seed)

Summary
- Short goal: help an AI coding agent become productive quickly by outlining where to look, what commands to run, and which files encode architecture and workflows.

Quick discovery steps (run first)
1. List top-level files and directories.
   - Windows PowerShell: Get-ChildItem -Force -Name
2. Search for common manifests and CI files:
   - CMakeLists.txt, Makefile, package.json, pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, pom.xml, build.gradle, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .github/workflows
3. Run manifest-specific checks to reveal build/test commands:
   - If `CMakeLists.txt` exists: mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; make test
   - If `Makefile` exists: make all; make test
   - If `package.json` exists: npm ci; npm test (or inspect `scripts`)
   - If `pyproject.toml` or requirements.txt: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt; pytest
   - If `pom.xml` or build.gradle: mvn -q -DskipTests=false test or ./gradlew test

How to infer architecture
- Look for these signals and report back with file paths and short summaries:
  - Monorepo: top-level `packages/`, `apps/`, `services/` with nested package manifests.
  - Services: folders with their own Dockerfile, CMakeLists.txt, or Makefile — treat as service boundaries (e.g., server/sql/, server/trans/, server/data/, server/admin/).
  - Shared code: `libs/`, `common/`, or `core/` used by multiple services (e.g., common/ for tenant context, core/tenant/ for tenant management).
  - Communication: presence of tenant context passing, resource stats interfaces, or cgroup integration indicates multi-tenant boundaries.

Developer workflows (what to extract and document)
- Build and test commands (exact commands from manifests or CI workflows). Copy the exact commands into this file.
- Local run / debug: how to start the app locally (single command or docker-compose). Record env vars and ports (e.g., SqlServer on port 3306, cgroup enabled via env ENABLE_CGROUP=true).
- CI: reference `.github/workflows/*.yml` and extract relevant jobs (build/test/lint/deploy).

Project-specific patterns (fill after scan)
- Example service: `server/sql/` — build: `cd build; make sql_server`; start: `./bin/sql_server --config config/tenant_config.ini --port 3306`.
- Example shared lib: `core/tenant/` — used by SqlServer and DataServer for tenant resource isolation (see ARCHITECTURE.md for tenant context passing).
- Multi-tenant isolation: Always pass TenantContext in request chains; use abstract ResourceStats interface for CPU/memory/disk monitoring (see CONTRIBUTING.md for module design).

Integration points & external deps
- Search for cgroup integration (Linux resource control), MySQL protocol libs, and infra files. External deps: cgroup for CPU isolation, LSM-tree storage, RAFT consensus. Cross-component: TenantContext flows from SqlServer to DataServer via request metadata.

Integration points & external deps
- Search for secrets management, cloud SDKs, and infra files (terraform/, k8s/). List endpoints, message brokers, or external APIs the code calls.

Merging guidance (if this file already exists)
- Preserve any human-written guidance. Only replace sections labelled `TODO` or `AUTOGENERATED`.
- When updating commands, prefer copying literal values from package manifests or `.github/workflows` rather than guessing.

When you finish
- Update the "Project-specific patterns" and "Developer workflows" sections with exact file paths and commands.
- Add 3 short examples (build, test, run) copied verbatim from manifests or CI.

Contact / Next steps
- If you want, I (the AI agent) can now:
  1) scan the repo and fill the TODOs automatically, or
  2) wait for you to provide the project files to merge real examples.
